        <br>To know the purposes of the children's corner in our historic café
        <br>We designed this corner specifically for children
        <br> To understand and benefit from the history of their country, and also to have it
        <br> A place to play instead of spending their time on social media.
        <br> Let the child know his origins and educate himself, for civilization teaches, while...
        <br> Culture enlightens. The first requires learning, while the second requires contemplation
